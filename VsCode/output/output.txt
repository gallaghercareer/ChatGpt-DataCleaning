(MHPAEA) - Non-Quantitative Treatment Limitations (NQTLs)___
Federal MHPAEA regulations provide that a plan cannot impose a Non-Quantitative Treatment Limitation
(NQTL) on mental health or substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits in any classification unless the
processes, strategies, evidentiary standards or other factors used in applying the NQTL to MH/SUD benefits are
comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, those used in applying the NQTL to medical/surgical
benefits in the same classification of benefits as written and in operation under the terms of the plan.
Non-Quantitative Treatment Limitations (NTQLs) include:
Medical management standards limiting or excluding benefits based on Medical Necessity or whether the
treatment is experimental or investigative;
Prescription drug formulary design;
Network admission standards;
Methods for determining in-network and non-network provider reimbursement rates;
Step therapy, a.k.a. fail-first requirements; and
Exclusions and/or restrictions based on geographic location, facility type or provider specialty.
A description of your Plan's NQTL methodologies and processes applied to medical/surgical benefits and
MH/SUD benefits is available for review by Plan Administrators (e.g. Employers) and covered persons

Statement of Rights Under the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act
Group health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under federal law, restrict benefits for any
hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours
following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, federal law generally
does not prohibit the mother's or newborn's attending provider, after consulting with the mother, from
discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In any case, plans and
issuers may not, under federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the issuer for
prescribing a 48 (or 96) hour length of stay.
Notice Regarding Provider Directories and Provider Networks
A list of network providers and network pharmacies is available, without charge, by visiting the website or
calling the phone number on your health care ID card. The network(s) consist of providers, including hospitals,
of varied specialties as well as general practice, and pharmacies, affiliated or contracted with Cigna or an
organization contracting on its behalf.
Direct Access to Obstetricians and Gynecologists
You do not need prior authorization from the Plan or from any other person (including a primary care provider)
in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in the network who
specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to comply with
certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved
treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who
specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, visit the website or contact customer service at the phone number shown
on your ID card.
Selection of a Primary Care Provider
This Plan allows the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care
provider who participates in the network and who is available to accept you or your family members. For
information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of network primary care providers, visit the
website or contact Member Services at the phone number listed on your ID card. A pediatrician may be
designated as a child's primary care provider.
Additional Programs
The Plan may from time to time, offer or arrange for various entities to offer discounts, benefits, or other
consideration to Members for the purpose of promoting general health and well-being. The Plan may also
arrange for the reimbursement of all or a portion of the cost of services by other parties to the group. Contact
Member Services for details regarding any such arrangements.
Care Management and Care Coordination Services
Janu ary 1, 2023 6INTRODUCTION_ -_ C_ontinued
The Plan may enter into specific collaborative arrangements with health care professionals committed to
improving quality care, patient satisfaction and affordability. Through these collaborative arrangements, health
care professionals commit to proactively providing participants with certain care management and care
coordination services to facilitate achievement of these goals. Reimbursement is provided at 100% for these
services when rendered by designated health care professionals in these collaborative arrangements.
Rebates and Other Payments
Cigna or its affiliates may receive rebates or other remuneration from pharmaceutical manufacturers in
connection with certain Medical Pharmaceuticals covered under the Plan and Prescription Drug Products
included on the Prescription Drug List. These rebates or remuneration are not obtained on your, the Employer's
or Plan's behalf, or for your benefit.
Cigna, its affiliates and the Plan are not obligated to pass these rebates on to you, or apply them to your Plan's
deductible, if any, or take them into account in determining your copay/coinsurance.
Cigna and its affiliates or designees may also conduct business with various pharmaceutical manufacturers
separate and apart from the Plan's Medical Pharmaceutical and Prescription Drug Product benefits. Such
business may include, but is not limited to, data collection, consulting, educational grants and research. Amounts
received from pharmaceutical manufacturers pursuant to such arrangements are not related to the Plan. Cigna
and its affiliates are not required to pass on to you, and do not pass on to you, such amounts.
Coupons, Incentives and Other Communications
At various times, Cigna or its designee may send mailings to you or your Dependents or to your Doctor that
communicate a variety of messages, including information about Medical Pharmaceuticals and Prescription
Drug Products. These mailings may contain coupons or offers from pharmaceutical manufacturers that enable
you or your Dependents, at your discretion, to purchase the described Medical Pharmaceutical and Prescription
Drug Product at a discount or to obtain it at no charge. Pharmaceutical manufacturers may pay for and/or
provide the content for these mailings. Cigna, its affiliates and the Plan are not responsible in any way for any
decision you make in connection with any coupon, incentive or other offer you may receive from a
pharmaceutical manufacturer or Doctor.
If Cigna determines that a Pharmacy, pharmaceutical manufacturer or other third party is or has waived, reduced
or forgiven any portion of the charges and/or any portion of any deductible, copay and/or coinsurance amount(s)
you are required to pay for a Prescription Drug Product without Cigna's express consent, then Cigna in its sole
discretion shall have the right to deny the payment of Plan benefits in connection with the Prescription Drug
Product, or reduce the benefits in proportion to the amount of any deductible, copay and/or coinsurance
amount(s) waived, forgiven or reduced, regardless of whether the Pharmacy, pharmaceutical manufacturer or
other third party represents that you remain responsible for any amounts that the Plan does not cover. In the
exercise of that discretion, Cigna shall have the right to require you to provide proof sufficient to Cigna that you
have made your required cost share payment(s) prior to the payment of any benefits by the Plan.
For example, if you use a coupon provided by a pharmaceutical manufacturer or other third party that discounts
the cost of a Prescription Drug Product, Cigna may, in its sole discretion, reduce the benefits provided under the
Plan in proportion to the amount of any deductible, copay or coinsurance amount(s) to which the value of the
coupon has been applied by the Pharmacy or other third party, and/or exclude from accumulation toward any
Plan deductible or out-of-pocket maximum the value of any coupon applied to any deductible, copay and/or
coinsurance you are required to pay.

SaveOnSP Specialty Program
As a participant in the Plan, you may opt to enroll in the SaveOnSP program, in which certain pharmaceutical
manufacturers may provide assistance for certain costs associated with specific Specialty Prescription Drug
Products that are used to treat various conditions, such as: hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory
bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, oncology and various others (specific drugs and manufacturer programs
may vary from time to time).
If you have enrolled and are receiving medications under this program, manufacturer assistance will reduce or
eliminate your out-of-pocket cost.
If you choose not to sign up with SaveOnSP, your prescription drug cost-share (the amount you pay) for the
medications listed, will be indicated at the link below, which may be amended from time to time. The Specialty
Prescription Drug Products included in this program are considered non-Essential Health Benefits as set forth in
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) and any amount you pay will not count toward
your deductible or out-of-pocket maximums, if any.
To determine if your medication qualifies for the SaveOnSP program, you can go to www.saveonsp.com/cigna-
west or contact SaveOnSP at 800-683-1074.

Janu ary 1, 2023 9OPEN ACCESS PLUS MEDICAL BENEFITS SCHEDULE___
This Schedule provides a general description of medical benefits. It does not list all benefits. The Plan contains
limitations and restrictions that could reduce the benefits payable under the Plan. Please read the entire booklet
for details about your benefits.
When you select a network provider, this Plan pays a greater share of the costs than if you select a
provider that is not a network provider. For the names of network providers, contact Member Services at
the phone number or website address shown on the Member ID card. You are responsible for confirming
that a provider is a network provider.
When you receive services from a network provider, remind your provider to utilize network providers
for x-rays, lab tests and other services so that the cost may be considered at the network level.
Multiple Surgical Reduction
Multiple covered surgeries performed during one operating session result in payment reduction of 50% to the
surgery of lesser charge. The most expensive procedure is paid as any other surgery.
Assistant Surgeon and Co-Surgeon Charges
Assistant Surgeon Charges - The maximum amount payable will be limited to charges made by an assistant
surgeon that do not exceed a percentage of the surgeon's allowable charge as specified in Cigna reimbursement

amount specified in Cigna reimbursement policies.

Participating (Out-of-Network) provider.
The allowable amount used to determine the Plan's benefit payment for covered Emergency Services rendered in
an Out-of-Network Hospital, or by an Out-of-Network provider in an In-Network Hospital, is the amount agreed
to by the Out-of-Network provider and Cigna, or as required by applicable state or Federal law.
The allowable amount used to determine the Plan's benefit payment when Out-of-Network Emergency Services
result in an inpatient admission is the median amount negotiated with In-Network facilities.
The member is responsible for applicable In-Network cost-sharing amounts (any deductible, copay or
coinsurance). The member is not responsible for any charges that may be made in excess of the allowable
amount. If the Out-of-Network provider bills you for an amount higher than the amount you owe as indicated on
the Explanation of Benefits (EOB), contact Cigna Customer Service at the phone number on your ID card.
Out-of-Network Charges for Certain Services
Charges for services furnished by an Out-of-Network provider in an In-Network facility while you are receiving

provider and Cigna, or as required by applicable state or Federal law.

Janu ary 1, 2023 23PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS SCHEDULE___
This Plan provides prescription drug benefits for Prescription Drug Products provided by Pharmacies as
described in this booklet. This Schedule provides a general description of prescription drug benefits, but it does
not list all benefits. The Plan contains limitations and restrictions that could reduce the benefits payable under
the Plan. Please read the entire booklet for details about your benefits. As used in this Schedule, any reference to
“you” or “your” means you and your covered Dependent(s) (the Member).
A list of Network Pharmacies is available through the website or by contacting Member Services at the phone
number shown on your ID card.
To receive prescription drug benefits, you may be required to pay a portion of the covered expenses for
Prescription Drug Products. That portion includes any applicable deductible, copay and/or coinsurance.
You will pay 100% of the Prescription Drug Charge at a Network Pharmacy for Prescription Drug Products that
are excluded under this Plan, and any such amount will not count toward your Deductible, if any, or Out-of-
Pocket Maximum.
Certain PPACA Preventive Medications covered under this Plan and required as part of preventive care (details
at www.healthcare.gov) are payable at 100% not subject to any deductible, copay or coinsurance, when
purchased from a Network Pharmacy. A written prescription is required.
FDA-approved prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) tobacco cessation medications covered under this Plan
and required as part of preventive care (details at www.healthcare.gov), when prescribed by a Doctor for tobacco
use cessation and purchased from a Network Pharmacy are covered at 100% not subject to any deductible,
copay or coinsurance. This includes generic medications, and some brand name medications when certain
criteria are met. A written prescription is required.
Generic oral contraceptives and other prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) contraceptives covered under this
Plan and required as part of preventive care (details at www.healthcare.gov), when prescribed by a Doctor for
birth control and purchased from a Network Pharmacy are covered at 100% not subject to any deductible, copay
or coinsurance. A written prescription is required.
Patient Assurance Program - Your Plan offers additional discounts for certain covered Prescription Drug
Products that are dispensed by a retail or home delivery Network Pharmacy included in what is known as the
“Patient Assurance Program”.
As may be described elsewhere in this Plan, from time to time Cigna may directly or indirectly enter into
arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for discounts that result in a reduction of your out-of-pocket
expenses for certain covered Prescription Drug Products for which Cigna directly or indirectly earns the
discounts.
Specifically, some or all of the Patient Assurance Program discount earned by Cigna for certain covered
Prescription Drug Products included in the Patient Assurance Program is applied or credited to a portion of your
copay or coinsurance, if any. The copay or coinsurance, if any, otherwise applicable to those certain covered
Prescription Drug Products included in the Patient Assurance Program is applied or credited to a portion of your
copay or coinsurance, if any.
The copay or coinsurance, if any, otherwise applicable to those certain covered Prescription Drug Products as set
forth in this Schedule may be reduced in order for Patient Assurance Program discounts earned by Cigna to be
applied or credited to the copay or coinsurance, if any, as described above.
Janu ary 1, 2023 24PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS SCHEDULE _-_ C_ontinued
For example, certain insulin product(s) covered under the Prescription Drug benefit for which Cigna directly or
indirectly earns a discount in connection with the Patient Assurance Program shall result in a credit toward some
or all of your copay or coinsurance, if any, which, as noted, may be reduced from the amount set forth in this
Schedule for the insulin product. In addition, the covered insulin products eligible for Patient Assurance
Program discounts shall not be subject to the deductible, if any.
Your copay or coinsurance payment, if any, for covered Prescription Drug Products under the Patient Assurance
Program counts toward your out-of-pocket maximum.
Any Patient Assurance Program discount that is used to satisfy your copay or coinsurance, if any, for covered
Prescription Drug Products under the Patient Assurance Program counts toward your out-of-pocket maximum.
Please note that the Patient Assurance Program discounts that Cigna may earn for Prescription Drug Products,
and may apply or credit to your copay or coinsurance, if any, in connection with the Patient Assurance Program
are unrelated to any rebates or other payments that Cigna may earn from a pharmaceutical manufacturer for the
same or other Prescription Drug Products. Except as may be noted elsewhere in this Plan, you are not entitled to
the benefit of those rebates or other payments earned by Cigna because they are unrelated to the Patient
Assurance Program.
Additionally, the availability of the Patient Assurance Program, as well as the Prescription Drug Products
included in the Patient Assurance Program and/or your copay or coinsurance, if any, for those eligible
Prescription Drug Products, may change from time to time depending on factors including, but not limited to,
the continued availability of the Patient Assurance Program discount(s) to Cigna in connection with the Patient
Assurance Program. More information about the Patient Assurance Program including the Prescription Drug
Products included in the program, is available at the website shown on your ID card or by calling Member
Services at the telephone number on your ID card.

Anyone who is eligible as an Employee will not be considered as an eligible Dependent or Dependent spouse
unless the Dependent or Dependent spouse declines Employee coverage. A child under age 26 may be covered
as either an Employee or as a Dependent child. You cannot be covered as an Employee while also covered as a
Dependent of an Employee.
It is your responsibility to notify the Employer when a covered Dependent is no longer eligible for coverage.
Your Dependents must live in the United States to be eligible for coverage.
Eligible Dependents are:
your legal spouse; or
your Domestic Partner.

A medical child support order is a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) or a qualified national
medical support notice issued by a state court or administrative agency that requires the Plan to cover a child of
an Employee, if the Employee is eligible for benefits under the Plan.
When the Employer receives a medical support order, the Employer will determine whether the order is
“qualified”.
If the order is determined to be qualified, and if you are eligible to receive benefits under this Plan, then your
Dependent child will be covered, subject to any applicable contribution requirements. Your Employer will
provide your Dependent child with necessary information which includes, but is not limited to, a description of
coverages and ID cards, if any. Upon request, your Employer will provide at no charge, a description of
procedures governing medical child support orders.
Janu ary 1, 2023 28WHEN COVERAGE BEGINS & ENDS___

the Plan.
Coverage will begin on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the date you satisfy any
eligibility waiting period(s) as determined by your Employer, if you meet the Service definition in
ELIGIBILITY on that day, or if due to your health status you do not meet the Service definition on that day.
Before coverage can start, you must:
Submit an application within 30 days after becoming eligible;
Pay any required contribution.
Coverage for a newly acquired Dependent will begin on the date you acquire the Dependent if you are covered

for expenses incurred beyond the 31st day will be payable.
■ What If I Don't Apply On Time?
You are a late applicant under the Plan if you don't apply for coverage within 30 days of the date you become
eligible for coverage.
Your Dependent is a late applicant if you elect not to cover a Dependent and then later want coverage for that
Dependent.
A late applicant may apply for coverage only during an open enrollment period. The Plan Administrator can tell
you when the open enrollment period begins and ends. Coverage for a late applicant who applies during the
open enrollment period will begin on the first day of the month following the close of the open enrollment
period.
Your eligible Dependent is not a late applicant if you did not apply to cover the Dependent within 30 days of the
date you became eligible to do so and later are required by a qualified court order to provide coverage under this
Plan for that Dependent. If you apply within 30 days of the date the court order is issued, coverage will start on
the court ordered date.
Special Enrollment Rights

enrollment event, you may request enrollment in a different medical and prescription drug benefit option, if any,
offered by the Employer and for which you are currently eligible.
A special enrollment event occurs if:

eligible to do so because at the time you or your eligible Dependent was covered under another health
insurance plan or arrangement and coverage under the other plan was lost as a result of:

- Termination of benefits for a class of individuals and you or your eligible Dependent is included in that
class; or
- Termination of the employer's contribution for the other plan's coverage.
You must have stated in writing that the other health coverage was the reason you declined coverage under
this Plan, but only if the Employer required such a statement and notified you of the consequences of the
requirement when you declined coverage.

eligible to do so because at the time you or your eligible Dependent was covered under a state Medicaid or

did not apply for coverage for yourself or your eligible Dependent within 30 days of the date you were
eligible to do so and you or your eligible Dependent later becomes eligible for employment assistance under a
state Medicaid or CHIP plan that helps pay for the cost of this Plan's coverage. In this situation, you may
request coverage for yourself and/or any affected eligible Dependent not already enrolled in this Plan.
Coverage must be requested within 60 days of the date the Member is determined to be eligible for such
assistance.You
did not apply to cover yourself or an eligible Dependent within 30 days of the date you became eligible to
do so and later experience a change in family status because you acquire a Dependent through marriage, birth
or adoption. In this case, you may apply for coverage for yourself, your spouse and any newly acquired
Dependents.
If you apply within 30 days of the date:
Coverage is lost under the other plan, as described above, coverage will start on the day after coverage is lost
under the other plan.

the Member is determined to be eligible for employment assistance under a state Medicaid or CHIP plan,
coverage will start no later than the first day of the month following receipt of your enrollment request.

Janu ary 1, 2023 47PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS___
■ What's Covered? (Covered Expenses)
As used in this Prescription Drug Benefits section, any reference to “you” or “your” means you and your
covered Dependent(s) (the Member).
The Plan provides benefits for Prescription Drug Products dispensed by a Pharmacy. Details regarding the Plan's
covered expenses, which for the purpose of Prescription Drug Benefits includes Medically Necessary
Prescription Drug Products ordered by a Doctor, limitations and exclusions are provided in the PRESCRIPTION
DRUG BENEFITS SCHEDULE and as described in this booklet.
If you, while covered under the Plan for prescription drug benefits, incur expenses for charges made by a
Pharmacy for Medically Necessary Prescription Drug Products ordered by a Doctor, the Plan provides coverage
for those expenses as shown in the PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS SCHEDULE. Your benefits may vary
depending on which of the Prescription Drug List tiers the Prescription Drug Product is listed, or the Pharmacy
that provides the Prescription Drug Product.
The drug benefit includes coverage of contraceptives.
Coverage under the Plan's prescription drug benefit also includes Medically Necessary Prescription Drug
Products dispensed pursuant to a Prescription Order or Refill issued to you by a licensed Dentist for the
prevention of infection or pain in conjunction with a dental procedure.
When you are issued a Prescription Order or Refill for Medically Necessary Prescription Drug Products as part
of the rendering of Emergency Services and Cigna determines that it cannot reasonably be filled by a Network
Pharmacy, the Prescription Order or Refill will be covered by the Plan at the cost-share requirements applicable
to a Network Pharmacy.
Covered Prescription Drug Products purchased at a Pharmacy are subject to any applicable deductible, copay
and/or coinsurance shown on the PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS SCHEDULE. Please refer to that
SCHEDULE for any required deductible, copay and/or coinsurance, and any out-of-pocket maximums.
Copay - Your Plan requires that you pay a copay for covered Prescription Drug Products as set forth in the
PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS SCHEDULE. After satisfying any applicable annual deductible set forth in
the SCHEDULE, your costs under the Plan for a covered Prescription Drug Product dispensed by a Network
Pharmacy and that is subject to a copay requirement will be the lowest of the following amounts:
the copay for the Prescription Drug Product set forth in the SCHEDULE; or
the Prescription Drug Charge; or
the Network Pharmacy's submitted Usual and Customary (U&C) Charge, if any.
Payments at Non-Network Pharmacies - Any reimbursement due to you under this Plan for a covered
Prescription Drug Product dispensed by a non-network Pharmacy may be determined by applying the non-
network pharmacy copay and/or coinsurance amount set forth in the PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS
SCHEDULE to the average wholesale price (or “AWP”), or other benchmark price Cigna applies, for a
Prescription Drug Product dispensed by a non-network Pharmacy. Your reimbursement, if any, for a covered
Prescription Drug Product dispensed by a non-network Pharmacy will never exceed the average wholesale price
(or other benchmark price applied by Cigna) for the Prescription Drug Product.
When a treatment regimen contains more than one type of Prescription Drug Product packaged together for your
convenience, any applicable copay and/or coinsurance may apply to each Prescription Drug Product.
Janu ary 1, 2023 48PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS_ -_ C_ontinued
You will need to obtain prior approval from Cigna or its Review Organization for a Prescription Drug Product
not listed on the Prescription Drug List that is not otherwise excluded. If Cigna or its Review Organization
approves coverage for a Prescription Drug Product because it meets the applicable coverage exception criteria,
the Prescription Drug Product shall be covered at the applicable coverage tier as set forth in the
PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS SCHEDULE.
For most Prescription Drug Products you pay only the cost sharing detailed in the PRESCRIPTION DRUG
BENEFITS SCHEDULE. However, in the event you insist on a more expensive Brand Drug where a
Therapeutic Equivalent Generic Drug is available, you may be financially responsible for an Ancillary Charge,
in addition to any required Brand Drug copay and/or coinsurance. In this case, the Ancillary Charge will not
apply to any deductible or any out-of-pocket maximum. However, in the event your Doctor determines that the
Generic Drug is not an acceptable alternative for you (and indicates Dispense as Written on the Prescription
Order or Refill), you will only be responsible for payment of the appropriate Brand Drug copay and/or
coinsurance.
Your Plan includes a Brand Drug for Generic Drug dispensing program. This program allows certain Brand
Drugs to be dispensed in place of the Therapeutic Equivalent Generic Drug at the time your Prescription Order
or Refill is processed by a Network Pharmacy. Brand Drug for Generic Drug substitution will occur only for
certain Brand Drugs included in the program. When this substitution program is applied, the Network Pharmacy
will dispense the Brand Drug to you in place of the available Generic Drug. You will be responsible for payment
of only a Generic Drug copay and/or coinsurance, after satisfying your deductible, if any.
Prescription Drug List Management
Your Plan's Prescription Drug List may contain Prescription Drug Products that are Generic Drugs, Brand Drugs
or Specialty Prescription Drug Products. Determination of inclusion of a Prescription Drug Product on the
Prescription Drug List and utilization management requirements or other coverage conditions are based on a
number of factors which may include clinical and economic factors. Clinical factors may include, but are not
limited to, the P&T Committee's evaluations of the place in therapy, relative safety or relative efficacy of the
Prescription Drug Product, as well as whether certain supply limits or other utilization management
requirements should apply. Economic factors may include, but are not limited to, the Prescription Drug Product's
acquisition cost including, but not limited to, assessments on the cost effectiveness of the Prescription Drug
Product and available rebates. Regardless of its eligibility for coverage under the Plan, whether a particular
Prescription Drug Product is appropriate for you is a determination that is made by you and the prescribing
Doctor.
The coverage status of a Prescription Drug Product may change periodically for various reasons. For example, a
Prescription Drug Product may be removed from the market, a New Prescription Drug Product in the same
therapeutic class as a Prescription Drug Product may become available, or other market events may occur.
Market events that may affect the coverage status of a Prescription Drug Product include, but are not limited to,
an increase in the acquisition cost of a Prescription Drug Product. As a result of coverage changes, for the
purpose of benefits the Plan may require you to pay more or less for that Prescription Drug Product, to obtain
the Prescription Drug Product from a certain Pharmacy(ies) for coverage, or try another covered Prescription
Drug Product(s). You may access the website or contact Member Services at the phone number on your ID card
for the most up-to-date tier status, utilization management, or other coverage limitations for a Prescription Drug
Product.
New Prescription Drug Products
Janu ary 1, 2023 49PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS_ -_ C_ontinued
New Prescription Drug Products may or may not be placed on a Prescription Drug List tier upon market entry.
Cigna will use reasonable efforts to make a tier placement decision for a New Prescription Drug Product within
six months of its market availability. Cigna's tier placement decision shall be based on consideration of, without
limitation, the P&T Committee's clinical review of the New Prescription Drug Product and economic factors. If
a New Prescription Drug Product not listed on the Prescription Drug List is approved by Cigna or its Review
Organization as Medically Necessary in the interim, the New Prescription Drug Product shall be covered at the
applicable coverage tier as set forth in the Schedule.
Prior Authorization Requirements
Coverage for certain Prescription Drug Products prescribed to you requires your Doctor to obtain prior
authorization from Cigna or its Review Organization. The reason for obtaining prior authorization is to
determine whether the Prescription Drug Product is Medically Necessary in accordance with coverage criteria.
Coverage criteria for a Prescription Drug Product may vary based on the clinical use for which the Prescription
Order or Refill is submitted, and may change periodically based on changes in, without limitation, clinical
guidelines or practice standards, or market factors.
If Cigna or its Review Organization reviews the documentation provided and determines that the Prescription
Drug Product is not Medically Necessary or is otherwise excluded, the Plan will not cover the Prescription Drug
Product. Cigna, or its Review Organization, will not review claims for excluded Prescription Drug Products or
other services to determine if they are Medically Necessary, unless required by law.
When Prescription Drug Products that require prior authorization are dispensed at a Pharmacy, you or your
prescribing Doctor are responsible for obtaining prior authorization from Cigna. If you do not obtain prior
authorization from Cigna or its Review Organization before the Prescription Drug Product is dispensed by the
Pharmacy, you can ask Cigna or its Review Organization to consider reimbursement after you pay for and
receive the Prescription Drug Product. You will need to pay for the Prescription Drug Product at the Pharmacy
prior to submitting a reimbursement request.
When you submit a claim on this basis, you will need to submit a paper claim using the form that appears on the
website shown on your ID card.
If a prior authorization request is approved, your Doctor will receive confirmation. The authorization will be
processed in the claim system to allow you to have coverage for the Prescription Drug Product. The length of
the authorization may depend on the diagnosis and the Prescription Drug Product. The authorization will at all
times be subject to the Plan's terms of coverage for the Prescription Drug Product, which may change from time
to time. When your Doctor advises you that coverage for the Prescription Drug Product has been approved, you
can contact a Pharmacy to fill the covered Prescription Order or Refill.
If the prior authorization request is denied, you and your Doctor will be notified that coverage for the
Prescription Drug Product is not authorized. If you disagree with a coverage decision, you may appeal that
decision in accordance with Plan provisions by submitting a written request stating why the Prescription Drug
Product should be covered.
Step Therapy
Janu ary 1, 2023 50PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS_ -_ C_ontinued
Certain Prescription Drug Products are subject to step therapy requirements. This means that in order to receive
benefits for such Prescription Drug Products you are required to try a different Prescription Drug Product(s)
first, unless you satisfy the Plan's exception criteria. You may identify whether a particular Prescription Drug
Product is subject to step therapy requirements through the website or by contacting Member Services at the
phone number shown on your ID card.
Supply Limits
Benefits for Prescription Drug Products are subject to supply limits stated in the SCHEDULE. For a single
Prescription Order or Refill, you may receive a Prescription Drug Product up to the stated supply limit.
Some products are subject to additional supply limits, quantity limits or dosage limits based on coverage criteria
that have been approved based on consideration of the P&T Committee's clinical findings. Coverage criteria are
subject to periodic review and modification. The limit may restrict the amount dispensed per Prescription Order
or Refill and/or the amount dispensed per month's supply, or may require that a minimum amount be dispensed.
You may determine whether a Prescription Drug Product has been assigned a dispensing supply limit, or similar
limit or requirement through the website or by contacting Member Services at the phone number shown on your
ID card.
Specialty Prescription Drug Products
Benefits are provided for Specialty Prescription Drug Products. If you require Specialty Drug Products, you may
be directed to a Designated Pharmacy with whom Cigna has an arrangement to provide those Specialty Drug
Products.
Specialty Clinical Days' Supply
Specialty clinical days' supply is designed to improve customer adherence and satisfaction while reducing the
waste of Specialty Prescription Drug Products resulting from changes in prescription drug therapy. Specialty
clinical days' supply uses clinical guidelines, customer experience, financial considerations, and Cigna's home
delivery pharmacy expertise to establish an optimum maximum days' supply for each fill of a Specialty
Prescription Drug Product. The maximum days' supply of a Specialty Prescription Drug product, dispensed by a
Cigna designated specialty pharmacy, may be limited to less than the home delivery days' supply maximum
indicated in The Schedule depending on the drug, condition, and demonstrated patient stability on prescription
drug therapy.
Designated Pharmacies
If you require certain Prescription Drug Products, including but not limited to, Specialty Prescription Drug
Products, you may be directed to a Designated Pharmacy with whom Cigna has an arrangement to provide those
Prescription Drug Products. If you are directed to a Designated Pharmacy and you choose not to obtain your
Prescription Drug Product from a Designated Pharmacy the Prescription Drug Product may not be covered.

expenses incurred by a participant to the extent reimbursable under automobile insurance coverage. Coverage
under this Plan is secondary to automobile no-fault insurance or similar coverage. The coverage provided
under this Plan does not constitute “Qualified Health Coverage” under Michigan law and therefore does not
replace Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage provided under an automobile insurance policy issued to a
Michigan resident. This Plan will cover expenses only not otherwise covered by the PIP coverage.
Prescription Drug Benefit Limitations and Exclusions
Coverage exclusions listed under “Medical Benefit Limitations and Exclusions” and “General Limitations and
Exclusions” also apply to benefits for Prescription Drug Products. In addition, the exclusions listed below apply
to benefits for Prescription Drug Products. When an exclusion or limitation applies to only certain Prescription
Drug Products, you can access the Prescription Drug List through the website shown on your ID card or call
Member Services at the telephone number on your ID card for information on which Prescription Drug Products
are excluded.
No amount will be payable for:
coverage for Prescription Drug Products for an amount dispensed (days' supply) which exceeds the applicable
supply limit or is less than any applicable supply minimum as set forth in the SCHEDULE, or which exceeds
quantity limit(s) or dosage limit(s) set by the P&T Committee.

■ How To File Claims
As used in this provision, any reference to “you” or “your” refers to the covered Member, and also refers to a
representative or provider designated by you to act on your behalf.
A claim form can be requested from the Plan Administrator, through the website address or by calling Member
Services at the phone number shown on your ID card. Complete and accurate claim information is necessary to
avoid claim processing delays.
Timely Filing of Claims
Cigna will consider claims for coverage, other than Network coverage, under the Plan when proof of loss (a
claim) is submitted within 180 days after expenses are incurred. If expenses are incurred on consecutive days,
such as for a Hospital confinement, the limit will be counted from the last date expenses are incurred. If the
claim is not submitted within the specified time period, it will not be considered valid and will be denied.
Medical Benefits
When using a network provider, you do not need to file a claim if you present your ID card. The network
provider will file the claim. When using other providers, claims can be submitted by the provider if the provider
is willing and able to file on your behalf. If the provider is not submitting on your behalf, you must send the
completed claim form and itemized bills to the address shown on your ID card.
Prescription Drug Benefits
When you purchase covered Prescription Drug Products through a Network Pharmacy, you pay at the time of
purchase any applicable deductible, copay or coinsurance shown in the SCHEDULE. You do not need to file a
claim form for a Prescription Drug Product obtained at a Network Pharmacy, unless you pay the full cost of a
Prescription Drug Product at a Network Pharmacy and later seek reimbursement for the Prescription Drug
Product under the Plan or you dispute the accuracy of your payment.
For example, if you must pay the full cost of a Prescription Drug Product to the retail Network Pharmacy
because you did not have your ID card, then you must submit a claim to Cigna for any reimbursement or benefit
you believe is due to you under this Plan. If, under this example, your payment to the retail Network Pharmacy
for the covered Prescription Drug Product exceeds any applicable copay, then you will be reimbursed the
difference, if any, between the applicable copay and the Prescription Drug Charge for the Prescription Drug
Product.
■ Claim Determinations and Appeal Procedures
As used in this provision, any reference to “you” or “your” refers to the covered Member, and also refers to a
representative or provider designated by you to act on your behalf, unless otherwise noted.
You may appoint an authorized representative to assist you in submitting a claim or appealing a claim denial.
However, Cigna in its role as benefits administrator, may require you to designate your authorized representative
in writing using a form approved by Cigna. At all times, the appointment of an authorized representative is
revocable by you. To ensure that a prior appointment remains valid, Cigna may require you to re-appoint your
authorized representative, from time to time.
Janu ary 1, 2023 57CLAIMS & LEGAL ACTION_ -_ C_ontinued
Cigna reserves the right to refuse to honor the appointment of a representative if Cigna reasonably determines
that the signature on an authorized representative form may not be yours; or the authorized representative may
not have disclosed to you all of the relevant facts and circumstances relating to the overpayment or
underpayment of any claim, including, for example, that the billing practices of the provider of services may
have jeopardized your coverage through the waiver of the cost-sharing amounts that you are required to pay
under the Plan.
If your designation of an authorized representative is revoked, or Cigna does not honor your designation, you
may appoint a new authorized representative at any time, in writing, using a form approved by Cigna.
Medical Necessity Determinations
In general, health services and benefits must be Medically Necessary to be covered under the Plan. The
procedures for determining Medical Necessity vary, according to the type of service or benefit requested and the
type of health plan. Medical Necessity determinations are made on either a preservice, concurrent or postservice
basis.
Certain services and benefits require prior authorization. You or your representative (typically your health care
provider) must request prior authorization according to the procedures described in this provision, in the
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM section of this Plan booklet, and in the health care provider's network
participation documents as applicable.
When services or benefits are determined to be not covered, you or your representative will receive a written
description of the adverse determination, and may appeal the determination. Appeal procedures are described in
this Plan booklet, in the provider's network participation documents as applicable, and in the determination
notices.
Note: An oral statement made to you by a representative of Cigna or its designee that indicates, for example, a
particular service is a covered expense, is authorized for coverage by the Plan, or that you are eligible for
coverage is not a guarantee that you will receive benefits for services under this Plan. Cigna will make a benefit
determination after a claim is received from you or your authorized representative, and the benefit determination
will be based on your eligibility as of the date services were rendered to you and the terms and conditions of the
Plan in effective as of the date services were rendered to you.
Pre-Service Determinations
When you or your representative request a required prior authorization, Cigna will notify you or your
representative of the determination within 15 days after receiving the request. However, if more time is needed
to make a determination due to matters beyond Cigna's control, Cigna will notify you or your representative
within 15 days after receiving your request. This notice will include the date a determination can be expected,
which will be no more than 30 days after receipt of the request. If more time is needed because necessary
information is missing from the request, the notice will also specify what information is needed, and you or your
representative must provide the specified information to Cigna within 45 days after receiving the notice. The
determination period will be suspended on the date Cigna sends such a notice of missing information, and the
determination period will resume on the date you or your representative respond to the notice.

If the determination periods above would seriously jeopardize your life or health, ability to regain maximum
function; or in the opinion of a health care provider with knowledge of your health condition, cause you severe
pain which cannot be managed without the requested care; then Cigna will make the pre-service determination
on an expedited basis. Cigna will defer to the determination of the treating health care provider, regarding
whether an expedited determination is necessary. Cigna will notify you or your representative of an expedited
determination within 72 hours after receiving the request.
However, if necessary information is missing from the request, Cigna will notify you or your representative
within 24 hours after receiving the request to specify what information is needed. You or your representative
must provide the specified information within 48 hours after receiving the notice. Cigna will notify you or your
representative of the expedited benefit determination within 48 hours after you or your representative responds
to the notice. Expedited determinations may be provided orally, followed within 3 days by written or electronic
notification.
If you or your representative attempts to request a pre-service determination, but fails to follow Cigna's
procedures for requesting a required pre-service determination, Cigna will notify you or your representative of
the failure within 5 days (or 24 hours, if an expedited determination is required, as described above) after
receiving the request and describe the proper filing procedures. This notice may be provided orally, unless
written notice is requested.
Concurrent Determinations
When an ongoing course of treatment has been approved for you and you wish to extend the approval, you or
your representative must request a required concurrent coverage determination at least 24 hours prior the
expiration of the approved period of time or number of treatments. When you or your representative requests
such a determination, Cigna will notify you or your representative of the determination within 24 hours of
receiving the request.
Post-Service Determinations
When you or your representative requests a coverage determination or claim payment determination after care
has been provided, Cigna will notify you or your representative of the determination within 30 days after
receiving the request. However, if more time is needed to make a determination due to matters beyond Cigna's
control, Cigna will notify you within 30 days after receiving the request. This notice will include the date a
determination can be expected, which will be no more than 45 days after receipt of the request. If more time is
needed because necessary information is missing from the request, the notice will also specify what information
is needed, and you or your representative must provide the specified information to Cigna within 45 days after
receiving the notice. The determination period will be suspended on the date Cigna sends such a notice of
missing information, and the determination period will resume on the date you or your representative responds
to the notice.

COMPLAINTS and APPEALS - Cigna has a process for addressing your concerns.
Start with Customer Service
If you have a concern regarding a person, a service, the quality of care, contractual benefits, or a rescission of
coverage, you may call Customer Service at the phone number shown on your ID card, explanation of benefits
or claim form and explain your concern to a Customer Service representative. You may also express that
concern in writing.
Customer Service will make every effort to resolve the matter on your initial contact. If more time is needed to
review or investigate your concern, a response will be provided to you as soon as possible, but in any case
within 30 days. If you are not satisfied with the results of a coverage decision, you may start the appeals
procedure.
Internal Appeals Procedure
To initiate an appeal of an adverse benefit determination, you must submit a request for an appeal to Cigna
within 180 days of receipt of a denial notice. If you appeal a reduction or termination in coverage for an ongoing
course of treatment that Cigna previously approved, you will receive, as required by applicable law, continued
coverage pending the outcome of an appeal.
You should state the reason why you feel your appeal should be approved and include any information
supporting your appeal. If you are unable or choose not to write, you may ask Cigna to register your appeal by
telephone. Call Customer Service at the phone number shown on your ID card, explanation of benefits or claim
form.
Your appeal will be reviewed and the decision made by someone not involved in the initial decision. Appeals
involving Medical Necessity or clinical appropriateness will be considered by a health care professional.
Janu ary 1, 2023 60CLAIMS & LEGAL ACTION_ -_ C_ontinued
Cigna will respond in writing with a decision within 30 calendar days after receipt of an appeal for a required
preservice or concurrent care coverage determination, or a postservice Medical Necessity determination. Cigna
will respond within 60 calendar days after receipt of an appeal for any other postservice coverage determination.
If more time or information is needed to make the determination, Cigna will notify you in writing to request an
extension of up to 15 calendar days and to specify any additional information needed to complete the review.
In the event any new or additional information (evidence) is considered, relied upon or generated by Cigna in
connection with the appeal, this information will be provided automatically to you as soon as possible and
sufficiently in advance of the decision, so that you will have an opportunity to respond. Also, if any new or
additional rationale is considered by Cigna, Cigna will provide the rationale to you as soon as possible and
sufficiently in advance of the decision so that you will have an opportunity to respond.
You may request that the appeal process be expedited if the timeframes under this process would seriously
jeopardize your life, health or ability to regain maximum functionality or in the opinion of your health care
provider would cause you severe pain which cannot be managed without the requested care. If you request that
your appeal be expedited, you may also ask for an expedited external Independent Review at the same time, if
the time to complete an expedited internal appeal would be detrimental to your medical condition.
When an appeal is expedited, Cigna will respond orally with a decision within 72 hours, followed up in writing.
If you are dissatisfied with the internal appeal, you may request that your appeal be referred to an independent
review organization, as described in the External Review Procedure provision.
External Review Procedure
If you are not fully satisfied with the decision of Cigna's internal appeal review and the appeal involves medical
judgment or a rescission of coverage, you may request that your appeal be referred to an Independent Review
Organization (IRO). The IRO is composed of persons who are not employed by Cigna or any of its affiliates. A
decision to request an external review to an IRO will not affect the claimant's rights to any other benefits under
the Plan. There is no charge for you to initiate an external review. Cigna and your benefit plan will abide by the
decision of the IRO.
To request a review, you must notify Cigna's Appeals Coordinator within 4 months of receipt of Cigna's appeal
review denial. Cigna will then forward the file to a randomly selected IRO. The IRO will render a decision
within 45 days.
When requested, and if a delay would be detrimental to your medical condition, as determined by Cigna's
reviewer; or if your appeal concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or
service for which you received emergency services, but you have not yet been discharged from a facility; the
external review will be completed within 72 hours.
Notice of Benefit Determination on Appeal

available to assist you with the appeal process.
If your Plan is governed by ERISA, you have the right to bring a civil action under ERISA Section 502(a) if you
are not satisfied with the decision on review. You or your Plan may have other voluntary dispute resolution
options, such as mediation. One way to find out what may be available is to contact your local U.S. Department
of Labor Office. You may also contact the Plan Administrator.
“Relevant Information” means any document, record or other information that: was relied upon in making the
benefit determination; was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making the benefit determination,
without regard to whether such document, record, or other information was relied upon in making the benefit
determination; demonstrates compliance with the administrative processes and safeguards required by federal
law in making the benefit determination; constitutes a statement of policy or guidance with respect to the Plan
concerning the denied treatment option or benefit for the claimant's diagnosis, without regard to whether such
advice or statement was relied upon in making the benefit determination.
Legal Action
If your Plan is governed by ERISA, you have the right to bring a civil action under ERISA Section 502(a) if you
are not satisfied with the outcome of the Appeals Procedure. In most instances, you may not initiate a legal
action against Cigna until you have completed the appeal processes, as applicable. Legal action must be taken
for network expenses within 3 years after a claim is submitted, and for expenses other than network expenses
within 3 years after proof of claim is required under the Plan.
■ What If a Member Has Other Coverage? (Coordination of Benefits)
This Coordination of Benefits provision applies if you or any one of your Dependents is covered under more
than one Plan, and determines how benefits payable from all Plans will be coordinated. Claims should be filed
with each Plan.
As used in this provision, references to “you” or “your” refers to each covered Member.
This provision applies if you are covered under this Plan as an Employee and also as a Dependent of an
Employee.
This provision does not apply to your Prescription Drug Benefits.
Under this provision, total payments from the Primary and Secondary Plans will never be more than the
expenses actually incurred.

Definitions
For the purpose of this provision, the following terms have the meanings described here:
“Plan” means any of the following that provides health care benefits, services or treatment:
- this Plan.
- group insurance and/or group-type coverage, whether insured or self-insured which neither can be purchased
by the general public, nor is individually underwritten, including Closed Panel coverage.
- non-group insurance and subscriber contracts.
- coverage under Medicare and other governmental benefits as permitted by law, except Medicaid and
Medicare supplement policies.
- health care benefits coverage of group, group-type and individual automobile contracts.
Each Plan or part of a Plan which has the right to coordinate benefits will be considered a separate Plan.
“Closed Panel Plan” means a Plan that provides health care benefits primarily in the form of services or
supplies through a panel of employed or contracted providers, and that limits or excludes benefits provided
outside of the panel, except in the case of emergency or if referred by a provider within the panel.
“Primary Plan” means the Plan that determines and provides or pays benefits without taking into consideration
the existence of any other Plan.
“Secondary Plan” means a Plan that determines, and may reduce its benefits after taking into consideration,
the benefits provided or paid by the Primary Plan. A Secondary Plan may also recover from the Primary Plan
the Reasonable Cash Value of any services it provided to you.
“Allowable Expense” means the amount of charges considered for payment under the Plan for a covered
service prior to any reductions due to deductible, copay or coinsurance amount(s). If Cigna contracts with an
entity to arrange for the provision of covered services through that entity's contracted network of health care
providers, the amount that Cigna has agreed to pay that entity is the allowable amount used to determine your
deductible, copay or coinsurance payment(s). If the Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the
Reasonable Cash Value of each service is the Allowable Expense and is a paid benefit.
Examples of expenses or services that are not Allowable Expenses include, but are not limited to, the
following:
- An expense or service or a portion of an expense or service that is not covered by any of the Plans is not an
Allowable Expense.
- The difference between the cost of a private Hospital room and a semiprivate Hospital room, unless the
patient's stay in a private Hospital room is Medically Necessary, is not an Allowable Expense.
- If you are covered by two or more Plans that provide services or supplies on the basis of reasonable and
customary fees, any amount in excess of the highest reasonable and customary fee is not an Allowable
Expense.
- If you are covered by one Plan that provides services or supplies on the basis of reasonable and customary
fees and one Plan that provides services and supplies on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's fee
arrangement is the Allowable Expense.
- If your benefits are reduced under the Primary Plan (through imposition of a higher copayment amount,
higher coinsurance percentage, a deductible and/or a penalty) because you did not comply with Plan
provisions or because you did not use a preferred provider, the amount of the reduction is not an Allowable
Expense. Such Plan provisions include second surgical opinions and precertification of admissions or
services.
“Claim Determination Period” means a calendar year, but does not include any part of a year during which you
are not covered under this Plan or any date before this provision or any similar provision takes effect.
Janu ary 1, 2023 63CLAIMS & LEGAL ACTION_ -_ C_ontinued
“Reasonable Cash Value” means an amount which a duly licensed provider of health care services or supplies
usually charges patients and which is within the range of fees usually charged for the same service or supply
by other health care providers located within the immediate geographic area where the health care service or
supply is rendered under similar or comparable circumstances.
Order of Benefit Determination Rules
A Plan that does not have a coordination of benefits rule consistent with this provision will always be the
Primary Plan.
If the Plan has a coordination of benefits rule consistent with this provision, the first of the following rules that
applies to the situation is the one to use:
The Plan that covers you as an enrollee or an employee is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covers you as a
dependent is the Secondary Plan.
If you are a dependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the Primary Plan is the Plan
that covers the parent whose birthday falls first in the calendar year as an enrollee or employee.
If you are the dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the Dependent are determined in the
following order:
- first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health
coverage and the Plan for that parent has actual knowledge of the terms of the order, but only from the time
of actual knowledge;
- then, the Plan of the parent with custody of the child;
- then, the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child;
- then, the Plan of the parent not having custody of the child; and
- finally, the Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child.
The Plan that covers you as an active employee (or as that employee's dependent) is the Primary Plan and the
Plan that covers you as a laid-off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent) is the Secondary Plan.
If the other Plan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the Plans cannot agree on the order of
benefit determination, this paragraph does not apply.
The Plan that covers you under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law is the Secondary Plan
and the Plan that covers you as an active employee or retiree (or as that employee's dependent) is the Primary
Plan. If the other Plan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the Plans cannot agree on the order of
benefit determination, this paragraph does not apply.
If one of the Plans determines the order of benefits based on the gender of a parent, and as a result, the Plans
do not agree on the order of benefit determination, the Plan with the gender rule determines the order of
benefits.
If none of the above rules determine the order of benefits, the Plan that has covered you for a longer period of
time is the Primary Plan.
When coordinating benefits with Medicare, this Plan is the Secondary Plan and determines benefits after
Medicare, where permitted by the Social Security Act of 1965, as amended. However, when more than one Plan
is secondary to Medicare, the benefit determination rules identified above are used to determine how benefits
will be coordinated.
Effect on the Benefits of This Plan
The Coordination of Benefits provision is applied throughout each Claim Determination Period.
Janu ary 1, 2023 64CLAIMS & LEGAL ACTION_ -_ C_ontinued
If this Plan is the Secondary Plan, this Plan may reduce benefits so that the total benefits paid by all Plans during
a Claim Determination Period are not more than 100% of the total of all Allowable Expenses.
If this Plan is the Secondary Plan, it pays the lesser of:
the Allowable Expenses that were not reimbursed under the other Plan; or
the amount this Plan would have paid if there were no other coverage.
When the benefits of a government Plan are taken into consideration, the Allowable Expense is limited to the
benefits provided by that Plan.
When the Coordination of Benefits provision reduces the benefits payable under this Plan, each benefit will be
reduced proportionately and only the reduced amount will be charged against any benefit limits under this Plan.
Recovery of Excess Benefits
If this Plan pays charges for benefits that should have been paid by the Primary Plan, or if this Plan pays charges
in excess of those for which this Plan is obligated to pay, this Plan has the right to recover the actual payment
made or the Reasonable Cash Value of any services.
This Plan may seek recovery from any person to, or for whom, or with respect to whom, such services or
supplies were provided or such payments made by any insurance company, health care plan or other
organization. If requested, you must execute and deliver to this Plan any such instruments and documents as
determined necessary to secure the right of recovery.
Right to Receive and Release Information
Without consent or notice to you, information may be obtained from you, and information may be released to
any other Plan with respect to you, in order to coordinate your benefits pursuant to this provision. You must
provide any information requested in order to coordinate your benefits pursuant to this provision. This request
may occur in connection with a submitted claim; if so you will be advised that the “other coverage” information,
including an explanation of benefits paid under another Plan, is required before the claim will be processed for
payment. If no response is received within 55 days of the request, the claim will be closed. If the requested
information is subsequently received, the claim will be processed.
■ Coordination of Benefits with Medicare
If you, your spouse or your Dependent is covered under this Plan and qualify for Medicare, federal law
determines which plan is the primary payer and which is the secondary payer. The primary payer always
determines covered benefits first, without considering what any other coverage will pay. The secondary payer
determines its coverage only after the primary plan has completed its determination.
When Medicare is the Primary Payer
Medicare will be the primary payer and this Plan will be the secondary payer, even if you or your spouse or your
Dependent do not elect to enroll in Medicare or you or your spouse or your Dependent receive services from a
provider who does not accept Medicare payments (see IMPORTANT NOTE below), in the following situations:
COBRA or State Continuation: You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare for any
reason and are covered under this Plan due to COBRA or state continuation of coverage.
Janu ary 1, 2023 65CLAIMS & LEGAL ACTION_ -_ C_ontinued
Retirement or Termination of Employment: You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare
for any reason and are covered under this Plan due to your retirement or termination of employment.
Disability: You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare due to a disability, you are an
active Employee, and your Employer has fewer than 100 employees.
Age: You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare due to age, you are an active
Employee, and your Employer has fewer than 20 employees.
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare due to
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and you are an active or retired Employee. This Plan will be the primary
payer for the first 30 months. Beginning with the 31st month, Medicare will be the primary payer.
When this Plan is the Primary Payer
This Plan will be the primary payer and Medicare will be the secondary payer in the following situations:
Disability: You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare due to a disability, you are an
active Employee, and your Employer has 100 or more employees.
Age: You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare due to age, you are an active
Employee, and your Employer has 20 or more employees.
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): You, your spouse or your covered Dependent qualify for Medicare due to
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and you are an active or retired Employee. This Plan is the primary payer
for the first 30 months. Beginning with the 31st month, Medicare will be the primary payer.
Domestic Partners
Under federal law, when Medicare coverage is due to age, Medicare is always the primary payer and this Plan is
the secondary payer for a person covered under this Plan as a domestic partner (including Domestic Partners as
defined in the Plan). However, when Medicare coverage is due to disability, the Disability payer explanations
above will apply.
IMPORTANT NOTE
If you, your spouse or your Dependent do not elect to enroll in Medicare Parts A and/or B when first eligible, or
receive services from a provider who does not accept Medicare payments, this Plan will calculate payment based
on what should have been paid by Medicare as the primary payer if the person had been enrolled or had received
services from a provider who accepts Medicare payments. A person is considered eligible for Medicare on the
earliest date any coverage under Medicare could become effective.
Failure to Enroll in Medicare
If you, your spouse or your Dependent do not enroll in Medicare Parts A and/or B during the person's initial
Medicare enrollment period, or the person opts out of coverage, the person may be subject to Medicare late
enrollment penalties, which can cause a delay in coverage and result in higher Medicare premiums when the
person does enroll. It can also result in a reduction in coverage under Medicare Parts A and B. If you are
planning to retire or terminate employment and you will be eligible for any COBRA or state continuation or
retiree coverage under this Plan, you should enroll in Medicare before you terminate employment to avoid
penalties and to receive the maximum coverage under Medicare. Please consult Medicare or the Social Security
Administration for more information.

If a Participant incurs a covered expense for which, in the opinion of the Plan or its claim administrator, another
party may be responsible or for which the Participant may receive payment as described above:
Subrogation: The Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law, be subrogated to all rights, claims or interests that
a Participant may have against such party and shall automatically have a lien upon the proceeds of any
recovery by a Participant from such party to the extent of any benefits paid under the Plan. A Participant or
his/her representative shall execute such documents as may be required to secure the Plan's subrogation rights.
Right of Reimbursement: The Plan is also granted a right of reimbursement from the proceeds of any recovery
whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise. This right of reimbursement is cumulative with and not
exclusive of the above subrogation right, but only to the extent of the benefits provided by the Plan.
■ Lien of the Plan
By accepting benefits under this Plan, a Participant:
grants a lien and assigns to the Plan an amount equal to the benefits paid under the Plan against any recovery
made by or on behalf of the Participant which is binding on any attorney or other party who represents the
Participant whether or not an agent of the Participant or of any insurance company or other financially
responsible party against whom a Participant may have a claim provided said attorney, insurance carrier or
other party has been notified by the Plan or its agents.
agrees that this lien shall constitute a charge against the proceeds of any recovery and the Plan shall be entitled
to assert a security interest thereon.

made by the Plan.
■ Additional Terms
No adult Participant hereunder may assign any rights that it may have to recover medical expenses from any
third party or other person or entity to any minor Dependent of said adult Participant without the prior express
written consent of the Plan. The Plan's right to recover shall apply to decedents', minors', and incompetent or
disabled persons' settlements or recoveries.
No Participant shall make any settlement, which specifically reduces or excludes, or attempts to reduce or
exclude, the benefits provided by the Plan.
Janu ary 1, 2023 67CLAIMS & LEGAL ACTION_ -_ C_ontinued
The Plan's right of recovery shall be a prior lien against any proceeds recovered by the Participant. This right of
recovery shall not be defeated nor reduced by the application of any so-called “Made-Whole Doctrine”, “Rimes
Doctrine” or any other such doctrine purporting to defeat the Plan's recovery rights by allocating the proceeds
exclusively to non-medical expense damages.
No Participant hereunder shall incur any expenses on behalf of the Plan in pursuit of the Plan's rights hereunder,
specifically; no court costs, attorneys' fees or other representatives' fees may be deducted from the Plan's
recovery without the prior express written consent of the Plan. This right shall not be defeated by any so-called
“Fund Doctrine”, “Common Fund Doctrine” or “Attorney's Fund Doctrine”.
The Plan shall recover the full amount of benefits provided hereunder without regard to any claim of fault on the
part of any Participant, whether under comparative negligence or otherwise.
The Plan hereby disavows all equitable defenses in the pursuit of its right of recovery. The Plan's subrogation or
recovery rights are neither affected nor diminished by equitable defenses.
In the event that a Participant shall fail or refuse to honor its obligations hereunder, then the Plan shall be
entitled to recover any costs incurred in enforcing the terms hereof including, but not limited to, attorney's fees,
litigation, court costs and other expenses. The Plan shall also be entitled to offset the reimbursement obligation
against any entitlement to future medical benefits hereunder until the Participant has fully complied with his/her
reimbursement obligations hereunder, regardless of how those future medical benefits are incurred.
Any reference to state law in any other provision of this Plan shall not be applicable to this provision, if the Plan
is governed by ERISA. By acceptance of benefits under the Plan, the Participant agrees that a breach hereof
would cause irreparable and substantial harm and that no adequate remedy at law would exist. Further, the Plan
shall be entitled to invoke such equitable remedies as may be necessary to enforce the terms of the Plan,
including but not limited to, specific performance, restitution, the imposition of an equitable lien and/or
constructive trust, as well as injunctive relief.
Participants must assist the Plan in pursing any subrogation or recovery rights by providing requested
information.
■ Payment of Benefits
As used in this provision, any reference to “you” or “your” refers to the covered Member, and also refers to a
representative or provider designated by you to act on your behalf, unless otherwise noted.
Assignment and Payment of Benefits
You may not assign to any party, including but not limited to, a provider of health care services/items, your right
to benefits under this Plan, nor may you assign any administrative, statutory, or legal rights or causes of action
you may have under ERISA, if ERISA is applicable, including but not limited to, any right to make a claim for
Plan benefits, to request Plan or other documents, to file appeals of denied claims or grievances, or to file
lawsuits under ERISA, if ERISA is applicable. Any attempt to assign such rights shall be void and
unenforceable under all circumstances.
Janu ary 1, 2023 68CLAIMS & LEGAL ACTION_ -_ C_ontinued
You may, however, authorize payment of any health care benefits under this Plan to a Participating Provider or a
provider who is not a Participating Provider. When you authorize the payment of your health care benefits to a
Participating Provider or a provider who is not a Participating Provider, you authorize payment of the entire
amount of the benefits due on that claim. If a provider is overpaid because of accepting duplicate payments from
you and Cigna, it is the provider's responsibility to reimburse the overpayment to you. Cigna may pay all health
care benefits for Covered Expenses directly to a Participating Provider without your authorization. You may not
interpret or rely upon this discrete authorization or permission to pay any health care benefits to a Participating
Provider or a provider who is not a Participating Provider as the authority to assign any other rights under this
Plan to any party, including but not limited to, a provider of health care service/items.
Even if the payment of health care benefits to a provider who is not a Participating Provider has been authorized
by you, Cigna may, at its option, make payment of benefits to you. When benefits are paid to you or your
Dependents, you or your Dependents are responsible for reimbursing the provider who is not a Participating
Provider.
If any person to whom benefits are payable is a minor or, in the opinion of Cigna, is not able to give a valid
receipt for any payment due him, such payment may be made to his legal guardian. If no request for payment
has been made by his legal guardian, Cigna may, at its option, make payment to the person appearing to have
assumed his custody and support.
When a Plan participant passes away, Cigna may receive notice that an executor of the estate has been
established. The executor has the same rights as the participant and benefit payments for unassigned claims
should be made payable to the executor.
Payment as described above will release Cigna from all liability to the extent of any payment made.
Recovery of Overpayment
When an overpayment has been made by Cigna, Cigna will have the right at any time to: recover that
overpayment from the person to whom or on whose behalf it was made; or offset the amount of that
overpayment from a future claim payment. In addition, your acceptance of benefits under this Plan and/or
assignment of benefits separately creates an equitable lien by agreement pursuant to which Cigna may seek
recovery of any overpayment. You agree that Cigna, in seeking recovery of any overpayment as a contractual
right or as an equitable line by agreement, may pursue the general assets of the person or entity to whom or on
whose behalf the overpayment was made.
Calculation of Covered Expenses
Cigna in its discretion, will calculate Covered Expenses following evaluation and validation of all provider
billings in accordance with:
the methodologies in the most recent edition of the Current Procedural terminology.
the methodologies as reported by generally recognized professionals or publications.

Janu ary 1, 2023 80USERRA RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES___
The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), establishes
requirements for Employers and certain Employees who terminate Service with the Employer for the purpose of
Uniformed Service. This includes the right to continue the medical and prescription drug coverage that you (the
Employee) had in effect for yourself and your Dependents.
“Uniformed Service” means the performance of active duty in the Uniformed Services under competent
authority which includes training, full-time National Guard duty and the time necessary for a person to be absent
from employment for an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any of the assigned
duties.
You must notify your Employer verbally or in writing of your intent to leave employment and terminate your
Service with the Employer for the purpose of Uniformed Service. The notice must be provided at least 30 days
prior to the start of your leave, unless it is unreasonable or impossible for you to provide advance notice due to
reasons such as military necessity.
Continued Medical and Prescription Drug Coverage
Under USERRA, you are eligible to elect continued medical and prescription drug coverage for yourself and
your Dependents when you terminate Service with the Employer for the purpose of Uniformed Service.
The Employer should establish reasonable procedures for electing continued medical and prescription drug
coverage and for payment of contributions. See the Plan Administrator for details.
If you do not provide advance notice of your leave and you do not elect continued coverage prior to your leave
Coverage for you and your Dependents will terminate on the date that coverage would otherwise terminate due
to termination of your Service.
However, if you are excused from giving advance notice because it was unreasonable or impossible for you to
provide advance notice due to reasons such as military necessity, then coverage will be retroactively reinstated if
you elect coverage for yourself and your Dependents and pay all unpaid contributions within the period
specified in the Employer's reasonable procedures.
If you provide advance notice of your leave but you do not elect continued coverage prior to your leave
Coverage for you and your Dependents will terminate on the date that coverage would otherwise terminate due
to termination of your Service, when the duration of Uniformed Service is at least 30 days.
However, coverage will be retroactively reinstated if the Employer has established reasonable procedures for
election of continued coverage after the period of Uniformed Service begins, and you elect coverage for yourself
and your Dependents and pay all unpaid contributions within the time period specified in the procedures.
If the Employer has not established reasonable procedures, then the Employer must permit you to elect
continued coverage for yourself and your Dependents and pay all required contributions at any time during the
period of continued coverage, and the Employer must retroactively reinstate coverage.
If you elect continued coverage but do not make timely payments for the cost of coverage
If the Employer has established reasonable payment procedures and you do not make payments according to the
procedures, then coverage for you and your covered Dependents will terminate as described in the procedures.
Janu ary 1, 2023 81USERRA RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES _-_ C_ontinued
Period of Continued Coverage
During a leave for Uniformed Service, the period of continued coverage begins immediately following the date
you and your covered Dependents lose coverage under the Plan, and it continues for a maximum period of up to
24 months.
Cost of Continued Coverage
If the period of Uniformed Service is less than 31 days, you are not required to pay more than the amount that
you paid as an active Employee for that coverage for continued coverage.
If the period of Uniformed Service is 31 days or longer, then you will be required to pay up to 102% of the
applicable group rate for continued coverage.
COBRA Coverage
If you are eligible for COBRA continuation coverage, then the COBRA coverage period runs concurrently with
the USERRA coverage period. In some instances, COBRA coverage may continue longer than USERRA
coverage.
Reinstatement of Coverage
Coverage for an Employee who returns to Service with the Employer following Uniformed Service will be
reinstated upon request from the Employee and in accordance with USERRA.
Reinstated coverage will not be subject to any exclusion or waiting period, if such exclusion and/or waiting
period would not have been imposed had coverage not terminated as a result of Uniformed Service.
CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE - FMLA___
This provision applies if the Employer is subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as
amended. If you are eligible for FMLA leave and if the Employer approves your FMLA leave, coverage under
the Plan will continue during your leave. Contributions must be paid by you and/or the Employer. If
contributions are not paid, your coverage will cease. If you return to work on your scheduled date, coverage will
be on the same basis as that provided for any active Member on that date. If your coverage ends during FMLA
leave, a COBRA qualifying event occurs if you do not return to work on the date you are scheduled to return
from your FMLA leave. See the Plan Administrator with questions about FMLA leave.
CONTINUATION RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW - COBRA___
COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan, and was created by federal
law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).
Under this federal law, you and/or your covered Dependents (a covered Member) if a COBRA qualified
beneficiary, must be given the opportunity to continue Plan coverage when there is a “qualifying event” that
would result in loss of coverage under the Plan. The law permits continuation of the same Plan coverage under
which the qualified beneficiary was covered on the day before the qualifying event, unless the qualified
beneficiary moves out of the Plan's coverage area or the Plan is no longer available. If coverage options are
available, a qualified beneficiary has the same options to change coverage as others who are covered under the
Plan.
Janu ary 1, 2023 82CONTINUATION RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW - COBRA _- _C_ontinued
COBRA continuation coverage is available for you and your covered Dependents for up to 18 months from the
date of the following qualifying events if the event would result in a loss of coverage under the Plan:
your termination of employment for any reason, other than gross misconduct.
your reduction in work hours.
For your Dependents, COBRA continuation coverage is available for up to 36 months from the date of the
following qualifying events if the event would result in loss of coverage under the Plan:
your death.
your divorce or legal separation.
for a Dependent child, failure to continue to qualify as a Dependent under the Plan.
Only a qualified beneficiary, as defined by federal law, may elect COBRA continuation coverage. A qualified
beneficiary may include the following individuals who were covered under the Plan on the day the qualifying
event occurred: you, your spouse, and your Dependent children. Each qualified beneficiary has an independent
right to elect or decline COBRA continuation coverage, even if you decline or are not eligible for COBRA
continuation coverage.
The following individuals are not qualified beneficiaries for the purposes of COBRA continuation coverage:
domestic partners (including Domestic Partners as defined in the Plan), spouses who do not meet the definition
of spouse under federal law, and children (such as stepchildren, grandchildren) who have not been legally
adopted by you. Although these individuals do not have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation
coverage, if you elect COBRA continuation coverage for yourself you may also cover your Dependents even if
they are not considered qualified beneficiaries under COBRA. However, such individuals' coverage will
terminate when your COBRA continuation coverage terminates. The provisions “Secondary Qualifying Events”
and “Medicare Extension for Dependents” are not applicable to these individuals.
Secondary Qualifying Events
If, as a result of your termination of employment or reduction in work hours, your Dependent(s) elected COBRA
continuation coverage and one or more Dependents experience another COBRA qualifying event, the affected
Dependent(s) may elect to extend COBRA continuation coverage for an additional 18 months (7 months if the
secondary event occurs within the disability extension period) for a maximum of 36 months from the initial
qualifying event. The second qualifying event must occur before the end of the initial 18 months of COBRA
continuation coverage, or within the disability extension period. Under no circumstances with COBRA
continuation coverage be available for more than 36 months from the initial qualifying event. Secondary
qualifying events are: your death; your divorce or legal separation; or, for a Dependent child, failure to continue
to qualify as a Dependent under the Plan.
Disability Extension
If, after electing COBRA continuation coverage due to your termination of employment or reduction in work
hours, you or one of your Dependents is determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be totally
disabled under Title II or XVI of the SSA, you and all of your Dependents who have elected COBRA
continuation may extend such continuation for an additional 11 months, for a maximum of 29 months from the
initial qualifying event.
To qualify for the disability extension, both of the following requirements must be satisfied:
SSA must determine that the disability occurred prior to or within 60 days after the disabled individual elected
COBRA continuation coverage; and
Janu ary 1, 2023 83CONTINUATION RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW - COBRA _- _C_ontinued
a copy of the written SSA determination must be provided to the Plan Administrator within 60 calendar days
after the date the SSA determination is made AND before the end of the initial 18-month continuation period.
If the SSA later determines that the individual is no longer disabled, you must notify the Plan Administrator
within 30 days after the date the final determination is made by SSA. The 11-month disability extension will
terminate, for all individuals covered under the extension, on the first day of the month that is more than 30 days
after the date the SSA makes a final determination that the disabled individual is no longer disabled.
All causes for “Termination of COBRA Continuation Coverage” will also apply to the disability extension
period.
Medicare Extension
When the qualifying event is your termination of employment or reduction in work hours, and you became
covered under Medicare (Part A, Part B or both) within the 18 months before the qualifying event, the maximum
COBRA continuation period for you is 18 months from the date of your termination of employment or reduction
in work hours, and for your Dependents the maximum continuation period is 36 months from the date you
became covered under Medicare.
Termination of COBRA Continuation Coverage
COBRA continuation coverage will terminate when any of the following occurs:
the end of the COBRA continuation period of 18, 29 or 36 months; as applicable.
failure to pay the required cost of coverage as described in “COBRA Premiums”.
cancellation of the Employer's Plan.
after electing COBRA continuation coverage, a qualified beneficiary becomes covered under Medicare (Part
A, Part B or both).
after electing COBRA continuation coverage, a qualified beneficiary becomes covered under another group
health plan, unless the qualified beneficiary has a condition for which the new plan limits or excludes
coverage. In such a situation, COBRA continuation coverage will continue until the earlier of: the date the
condition becomes covered under the other plan or the occurrence of any of the events listed above.
after the date the qualified beneficiary qualifies as described in “Disability Extension”, the beneficiary is no
longer disabled.
any reason the Plan would terminate coverage of a participant or beneficiary who is not receiving COBRA
continuation (e.g., fraud).
Employer Notice Requirements
The Employer is required to provide the following notices:
Initial Notice - An initial notice of COBRA continuation rights must be provided within 90 days after Plan
coverage begins (or the Plan first becomes subject to COBRA continuation requirements, if later). If you
and/or your Dependents experience a qualifying event before the end of that 90-day period, the initial notice
must be provided within the time frame required for the COBRA election notice.
Election Notice - COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to qualified beneficiaries only after the
Employer's representative or Plan Administrator has been timely notified that a qualifying event has occurred,
and must be provided to you and/or your Dependents within the timeframe required by COBRA.
When the qualifying event is termination of employment, reduction of employment hours or the Employee's
death, a COBRA continuation election notice must be provided to you and/or your Dependents:
Janu ary 1, 2023 84CONTINUATION RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW - COBRA _- _C_ontinued
- if the Plan provides that the COBRA continuation coverage period starts upon the loss of coverage, within
44 days after loss of coverage under the Plan.
- if the Plan provides that the COBRA continuation coverage period starts upon the occurrence of a qualifying
event, within 44 days after the qualifying event occurs.
Electing COBRA Continuation Coverage
The COBRA continuation election notice will list the individuals who are eligible for COBRA continuation
coverage, and provide information about the applicable cost of coverage. The notice will also include
instructions for electing COBRA continuation coverage. You must notify the Plan Administrator of your
election in writing no later than the due date stated in the election notice. If written notice is mailed, it must be
post-marked no later than the due date stated in the election notice. If you do not make proper notification by the
due date stated in the election notice, you and your Dependents will lose the right to elect COBRA continuation
coverage. If you reject COBRA continuation coverage before the due date, you may change your mind as long
as you furnish a completed election form before the due date.
Each qualified beneficiary has an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. COBRA
continuation coverage may be elected for only one, several, or for all Dependents who are qualified
beneficiaries. Parents may elect to continue coverage on behalf of their Dependent children. You or your spouse
may elect COBRA continuation on behalf of all the qualified beneficiaries. You are not required to elect
COBRA continuation coverage in order for your Dependents to elect COBRA continuation coverage.
Cost of COBRA Continuation Coverage
Each qualified beneficiary may be required to pay the entire cost of COBRA continuation coverage. The amount
may not exceed 102% of the cost to the group health plan (including both Employer and Employee
contributions) for coverage of a similarly situated active Employee or family member. The cost during the 11-
month disability extension may not exceed 150% of the cost to the group health plan (including both Employer
and Employee contributions) for coverage of a similarly situated active Employee or family member.
For example: If the Employee alone elects COBRA continuation, the Employee or family member will be
charged 102% (or 150%, if applicable) of the active Employee cost of coverage. If the spouse or one Dependent
child alone elects COBRA continuation coverage, the individual will be charged 102% (or 150%, if applicable)
of the active Employee cost of coverage. If more than one qualified beneficiary elects COBRA continuation
coverage, they will be charged 102% (or 150%, if applicable) of the applicable family cost of coverage.
The first COBRA continuation coverage payment must be made no later than 45 calendar days after the date of
your election (if mailed, this is the date the election notice is postmarked). The qualified beneficiary is
responsible for making sure that the amount of the first payment is enough to cover the entire initial period from
the date coverage would have otherwise terminated, up to the date the qualified beneficiary makes the first
payment. If the first payment is not made within the 45-day period, all COBRA continuation rights under the
Plan will be lost. Claims incurred during the period covered by the initial payment period will not be processed
until the payment is made.
After the first payment is made, the qualified beneficiary is required to pay for each subsequent period of
coverage. If payment is made on or before its due date, coverage under the Plan will continue for that coverage
period without any break.
Janu ary 1, 2023 85CONTINUATION RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW - COBRA _- _C_ontinued
A grace period of 30 days after the first day of the coverage period will be given to make each periodic payment.
Coverage will be provided for each coverage period as long as payment for that coverage period is made before
the end of the grace period for that payment. However, if payment is received after the due date, coverage under
the Plan may be suspended during this time. Any providers who contact the Plan to confirm coverage during this
time may be informed that coverage has been suspended. If required payment is received before the end of the
grace period, coverage will be reinstated back to the beginning of the coverage period. This means that any
claim(s) submitted while coverage is suspended may be denied and may have to be resubmitted once coverage is
reinstated. If payment is not made before the end of the grace period for that coverage period, all rights to
COBRA continuation under the Plan will be lost.
You Must Give Notice of Certain Qualifying Events
If you or your Dependent(s) experience any of the following qualifying events, you or your Dependent(s) must
notify the Plan Administrator within 60 calendar days after the later of the date the qualifying event occurs or
the date coverage would end as a result of the qualifying event:
your divorce or legal separation.
your child no longer qualifies as a Dependent under the Plan.
the occurrence of a secondary qualifying event as described in “Secondary Qualifying Events” (this notice
must be received prior to the end of the initial 18-month or 29-month COBRA period). See “Disability
Extension” for additional notice requirements.
Notice must be made in writing and must include: the name of the Plan; name and address of the Employee
covered under the Plan; name and address(es) of the qualified beneficiaries affected by the qualifying event; the
qualifying event; the date the qualifying event occurred; and supporting documentation (e.g. divorce decree,
birth certificate, disability determination, etc.).
Newly Acquired Dependents
If you acquire a new Dependent through marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption while your
coverage is being continued, you may cover such Dependent under your COBRA continuation coverage.
Coverage is subject to the Plan's notice and/or application process for active Employees adding a new
Dependent. Only your newborn or adopted Dependent child is a qualified beneficiary for the purpose of
continuing COBRA coverage for the remainder of the coverage period following your early termination of
COBRA coverage or due to a secondary qualifying event. Any other Dependent added while your coverage is
being continued is not a qualified beneficiary for the purpose of continuing COBRA coverage for the remainder
of the coverage period following your early termination of COBRA coverage or due to a secondary qualifying
event.
Health FSA
The maximum COBRA coverage period for a health flexible spending arrangement (Health FSA), if maintained
by your Employer, ends on the last day of the Flexible Benefits Plan Year in which the qualifying event

Continue Group Health Plan Coverage
If a group health plan is subject to COBRA, you may be eligible to continue health care coverage for yourself or
your Dependents if there is a loss of coverage under the plan as a result of a COBRA qualifying event. You or
your Dependents may have to pay for such coverage. You may review the documents governing the plan or the
rules governing COBRA continuation coverage rights.
Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries
In addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible
for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate the plan, called “fiduciaries” of the plan,
have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one,
including the employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in
any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.
Enforce Your Rights
If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this
was done, to obtain without charge copies of documents relating to the decision and to appeal any denial, all
within certain time schedules.
Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of
documents governing the plan or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days,
you may file suit in federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the
materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent
because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or
ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.
In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a medical
child support order, you may file suit in federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's
money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S.
Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs
and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If
you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.
Assistance With Your Questions
If you have any questions about the plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions
about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from
the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration,
U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and
Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue
